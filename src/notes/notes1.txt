Handle Event: 
    * without para:<button onClick={myFunc}></button>
    *: With para: need to declear a arrow function in onClick. for example: <button onClick ={()=>{myFunc(23)}}>My btn</button>
    *: Direct function can be pass. 


1. You can handle events by passing a function as a prop to an element like <button>.

2. Event handlers must be pased, not called! onClick = {handleClick}, not onClick={handleClick()}.

3. You can define an event handler function sparately or inline.

4. Event handlers are defined inside a component, so they can acces props.

5. You can declear an event handler in a parent and pass it as prop to child.

6. You can define your own event handler props with wpllication-specific names.

7. Explicity calling an event handler prop from a child handler is a good alternative to progagation.
